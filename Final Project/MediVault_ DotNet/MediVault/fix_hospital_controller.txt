BACKEND FIX NEEDED:

In HospitalController.cs line 250, change:
return Ok(new { message = $"Doctor {(request.IsActive ? "activated" : "deactivated")}", doctor.Id, doctor.IsActive });

TO:
return Ok(new { message = $"Doctor {(request.IsActive ? "activated" : "deactivated")} successfully", doctor.Id, doctor.IsActive });

This will add "successfully" to match the Admin Dashboard format.
